# Quick Guide for Git

### Useful Command

#### Set up the user info
The first thing to do is to set up userâ€™s information. When the local repository is pushed to the server, every user knows who sent that commit and pushed it to the remote repository.

```console
$ git config --global user.name <user name>
$ git config --global user.email <user email address>
```

#### Clone a repository
It is common to start a project by cloning an existing repository from the server to the local system. To clone the repository, type the `$ git clone <repo>` in git bash and the repository will be copied to the current local directory.


#### Update the local repository from the server
Before adding a commit to git, it's better to update the local repository first by `$ git pull --rebase origin`.


#### Saving changes
After editing files, user can make these edited/new added/deleted files to the staging area so these files are ready to be committed. The files on the staging area will be committed at the same time so be careful.

```console
$ git add <file name>  # for adding specific edited/new added file to staging area
$ git rm <file name>  # for adding specific deleted file to staging area
$ git add -A   # for adding all edited/new added/deleted files to staging area
```
