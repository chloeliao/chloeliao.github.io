## Image Quality

### Specifications
#### Luma
Luma represents the brightness in an image. For digital formats following CCIR 601 (i.e. most digital standard definition formats), luma is calculated with this formula:

:<math> I = 0.299 R + 0.587 G + 0.114 B</math>


- Contrast: \frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}}.

- Modulation Transfer Function (MTF): The MTF is a measurement of its ability to transfer contrast at a particular resolution from the object to the image.
